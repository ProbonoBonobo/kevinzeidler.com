Well, the post you're currently reading is actually written as a JSON object with fields corresponding to the post's 'title', 'author', 'date'.", "At some point in the future, we'll probably write an GUI interface to the blog program that outputs JSON objects, and saves us from having to compose new posts in straight-up object notation. The blog.html page requests the json document, and if the request is successful, it will proceed to construct an HTML representation of the formatted page. For starters, it grabs the 0th blog post's title, inserts it between h1 tags, and appends the header to a designated DOM node. Cool, huh?</p><p>So, what happens next? Well, currently I haven't even gotten that far, but our next step will be to write some logic that iterates through the numbered keys of a 'posts.json' response object, and prints fixednum blog posts in order of recency! In fact, let's see if we can't figure that out right now. Stay tuned!"]
