They responded to my quote request almost immediately. They arrived early to the appointment. They were friendly. And they were quick to repair the broken screen. And they offered extra phone protection with a glass screen cover.You may find a (slightly) cheaper repair. You may find someone available immediately. But you won&#39;t find this service and value elsewhere.And yes, I am typing this review on my cell phone. I can do that now that the gentlemen have repaired the cracked screen.John"

Thanks to the &#34;Request quote&#34; feature , I was able to fan out a quote request to multiple vendors. The first response that I got , within a minute , was from Jacob. And none of the others were able to beat the price quoted by JacobThe fact that they offer a mobile repair service was an added bonus considering our unpredictable schedules. Set up an appointment for next day at my workplace. Jacob and Devin showed up a bit earlier in fact They were extremely professional , knowledgable ,got down to work without wasting a second. And replaced the broken screen in a jiffy. Also offered a tempered glass protector for a discount. The phone looked neat and new but I noticed some lines showing up when the screen was black. I just called them again to check if anything was wrong. They absolutely didn&#39;t mind coming back and checked once again. I really appreciate the honesty of these guys for I&#39;m sure 9/10 times I would have gotten a response that it was an existing fault with the phone if I had gone else where to fix the screen. Jacob did admit it was a problem with the screen(albeit the first instance for a 6 plus screen )and instantly replaced with another one without any issuesOn the whole it was a smooth process and would definitely seek out these guys if anything untoward happens to our phones  in the future"
