They have a guarantee on their work so if there are any issues with the screen (as long as it's not cracked) they will fix it!

Plus the screen is of excellent quality so i'm impressed and it cost me waaay less than what i had expected. I was also worried because i didn't have cash but he takes cards too. My only concern was that my iphone was so messed up (the edges around the screen were bent) that the screen was not fitting properly. After he took extra time and effort to make sure it fit, it was kind of popping out after and the iphone wouldn't detect touch but i fixed the problem by getting a good case that pushed the screen in and now i don't have any problems with it! I couldn't be happier with the results, and I definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs their screen repaired! Thanks Gabe !!"

I'm so happy . Will call Jacob in the future when I need anything . Trust this company

            [content] => I dropped my ipad and the cracked the screen. Augh! I looked at yelp and yelp recommended Mobile iphone and ipad screen repair. I can see why. Devin and Jacob came to my rescue! They came straight to my workplace and had it fixed in no time, seriously in the time it took for me to get back to the office and make a few phone calls they were already done. They were very professional and easy going. They even installed a tempered glass that will be less prone to cracking than the glass I had before. They have a guarantee on their work so if there are any issues with the screen (as long as it's not cracked) they will fix it! Jacob even recommended a better case for me so that it will protect the ipad better. Awesome five star service! I will recommend them to everyone.

Although the LCD screen was intact, the touchscreen was malfunctioning to a point where the phone was unusable. Jacob and Devin were able to fix it in less than 30 minutes! Both were very personable and professional. I would definitely recommend them to a friend. Their mobile service is fast and efficient, and best of all, they save you time by coming to you!

            [content] => Gabriel's service is very fast, professional, and convenient. I called & left a voicemail. He got back to me promptly and we set up an appt for the next day. He met me at the mall in fashion valley making it easy for me because I was shopping there. Within 15 minutes, my iphone screen was brand new!! Plus the screen is of excellent quality so i'm impressed and it cost me waaay less than what i had expected. I was also worried because i didn't have cash but he takes cards too. My only concern was that my iphone was so messed up (the edges around the screen were bent) that the screen was not fitting properly. After he took extra time and effort to make sure it fit, it was kind of popping out after and the iphone wouldn't detect touch but i fixed the problem by getting a good case that pushed the screen in and now i don't have any problems with it! I couldn't be happier with the results, and I definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs their screen repaired! Thanks Gabe !!
